# 🐛 the bug is on the table, a vibe-coded... thing

> *Wait, that's not a book...*

A delightfully chaotic bug-smashing game where insects (and other critters) roam a table and you get to... well, you know. 👊

## 🎮 What is this?

You know those moments when you're coding and suddenly you think "what if I made a game where bugs crawl on a table and you smash them"? Yeah, that happened. This is the result of a vibe coding session that got a little out of hand.

**Features:**
- 🪳 Bugs that move around (they're trying their best)
- 👊 Hand cursor that follows your mouse (desktop) or appears on touch (mobile)
- 💢 Angry emoji appears when you catch a bug (because they're not happy about it)
- 🔊 Satisfying slap sound effect (if your browser allows it)
- 📊 Live counter showing how many bugs you've smashed
- 🍑 Some unexpected "bugs" might appear (it's a feature, not a bug)

## 🚀 Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Start the dev server
yarn dev

# Open http://localhost:3000 and start smashing!
```

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Next.js 15** - Because why not use the latest?
- **React 19** - For that sweet component architecture
- **Tailwind CSS 4** - Styling made easy (and pretty)
- **TypeScript** - Type safety, because we're professionals (sometimes)

## 🎯 How to Play

1. Click "Let's hunt!" (or whatever the button says, I forget)
2. Move your mouse around (desktop) or tap bugs (mobile)
3. Watch bugs hop around trying to escape
4. Smash them when you catch them
5. Watch the counter go up
6. Feel slightly guilty about all the virtual bugs you've eliminated
7. Repeat

## 🐞 The Bugs

The game features a diverse cast of characters:
- 🪳 Cockroaches
- 🦟 Mosquitoes
- 🕷️ Spiders
- 🐜 Ants
- 🐛 Caterpillars
- 🐞 Ladybugs
- 🐝 Bees
- 🦗 Crickets
- 🍑 Peaches (yes, really)
- 🪰 Flies
- 🦋 Butterflies

*Some of these are definitely not bugs, but we're not here to judge.*

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

- **Minimalist** - Clean table, clean code (mostly)
- **Satisfying** - That slap sound hits different
- **Responsive** - Works on desktop and mobile (bugs don't discriminate)
- **Accessible** - Well, as accessible as a bug-smashing game can be
